Welcome to **deepbots**' documentation!
=======================================


`Deepbots <https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepbots>`_ is a simple framework
which is used as "middleware" between the free and open-source
`Cyberbotics' Webots <https://cyberbotics.com>`_ robot simulator
and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. When it comes to RL,
`gym <https://www.gymlibrary.dev>`_ environments have been established
as the most used interface between the actual application and the RL algorithm.

**Deepbots is a framework which follows the gym interface logic and bridges the
gap between the gym environment and the simulator to enable you to easily
create custom RL environments in Webots.**
